# Planning Rules and Recommendations System

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive planning assessment rules used in the High Level Planning Viability (HLPV) assessment system. The system evaluates development sites against various planning constraints and provides risk-based recommendations to inform early-stage development decisions.

## Risk Level Framework

All rules are assigned one of seven risk levels, in order of severity:

1. **SHOWSTOPPER** - Development not viable, alternative sites should be considered
2. **EXTREMELY_HIGH_RISK** - Severe planning constraints, very unlikely to obtain permission
3. **HIGH_RISK** - Significant planning constraints requiring specialist input
4. **MEDIUM_HIGH_RISK** - Notable constraints requiring careful consideration
5. **MEDIUM_RISK** - Moderate constraints, standard mitigation likely needed
6. **MEDIUM_LOW_RISK** - Minor constraints, some additional assessment required
7. **LOW_RISK** - Limited constraints, standard planning processes apply

## Special Rule Logic

### Showstopper Override
When any rule triggers at **SHOWSTOPPER** level, the system operates as follows:
- **Heritage**: All triggered rules remain visible, but only showstopper recommendations are displayed
- **Other disciplines**: Only showstopper rules are shown, other rules are filtered out

Agricultural land rules assess the quality of agricultural land on development sites using the Agricultural Land Classification (ALC) system.

## Grade 1 Agricultural Land

#### **Rule: Grade 1 Agricultural Land On-Site**
- **Trigger**: Site contains Grade 1 agricultural land covering ≥20% of area
- **Risk Level**:
  - **SHOWSTOPPER** if ≥60% coverage
  - **EXTREMELY_HIGH_RISK** if 20-59% coverage
- **Recommendations**:
  - Presence of Grade 1 land constitutes a [showstopper/extremely high] risk

#### **Rule: Grade 2 Agricultural Land On-Site**
- **Trigger**: Site contains Grade 2 agricultural land covering ≥20% of area
- **Risk Level**:
  - **HIGH_RISK** if ≥80% coverage
  - **MEDIUM_HIGH_RISK** if 40-79% coverage
  - **MEDIUM_RISK** if 20-39% coverage
- **Recommendations**:

## Grade 3 Agricultural Land

#### **Rule: Grade 3 Agricultural Land On-Site**

# SYSTEM LOGIC AND IMPLEMENTATION

## Rule Processing Order
Rules within each discipline are processed in order of severity, with most restrictive conditions checked first.

## Showstopper Logic Implementation
- **Heritage**: Shows all triggered rules but suppresses non-showstopper recommendations
- **Landscape, Ecology, Agricultural, Renewables**: Only shows showstopper rules when present

## Risk Assessment Hierarchy
The overall risk for each discipline is determined by the highest risk level triggered. When multiple disciplines are assessed, the highest overall risk across all disciplines determines the site's overall planning viability.

## Distance-Based Triggers
Most rules use concentric buffer zones around the development site:
- **On-site**: Direct intersection with site boundary
- **Distance buffers**: 50m, 100m, 250m, 500m, 1km, 3km, 5km
- Rules typically exclude closer distances (e.g., "within 500m" excludes areas already caught by "within 250m")
